# Entertainment Center


Entertainment Center is a project for the udacity full stack web developer nanodegree. It displays information regarding several of my favorite movies in a web browser, including the titles, posters, and trailers for the movies.

## Installation

Simply clone the GitHub repository.

To do this, go into Git Bash and enter
`git clone https://github.com/SyntheticSlime/Project1`

If for some reason you have an old version of Entertainment Center simply use a pull instead
`git pull https://github.com/SyntheticSlime/Project1`

## Usage

In Command Prompt enter
`cd <folder path>
entertainment_center.py`

Entertainment Center should open a browser page. Several movie posters will show up with the movie title beneath each poster. Click on or near a poster to see the movie trailer.
